<h3>This is a story about proving, with data, that <i>No Diggity</i> by Blackstreet is timeless.</h3>
<p>Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.</p>
<p>But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all of music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.</p>
<p>20 years have passed since <i>No Diggity's</i> release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every song from the 90s, is a strong signal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children.
So let's examine every song that ever charted, 1990-1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.</p>
