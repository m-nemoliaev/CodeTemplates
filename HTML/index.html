    In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <strong>Cash Money</strong>. The Dirty South starts with <strong>LaFace Records</strong>. The east-coast/west-coast feud is <strong>Bad Boy vs.Death Row</strong>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.

    We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with <a href=twitter.com/kevinbeacham>Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href=en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment>Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlithing the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.
