        <p style="font-size: 16px; color: black;">There's this thing called the Bechdel Test. It measures just how male-dominated our beloved Netflix night really are. To pass, films need to satisfy three requirements:</p>

            <center>
                <b>

            It's a low bar, but many good movies don't pass.
            <em>Birdman</em> fails.
            <em>Avatar</em> fails. Fucking
            <em>Toy Story fails</em>. On
            <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/">bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for crowdsourcing Bechdel Test results, about

        It's a sad state since women exist in life, like, half the time.</p>

        <p>Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, one theory is simple: filmmakers, unironically, make movies about themselves (i.e., write what you know). Since the most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male-themes permeate into Hollywood's output. To see if women are more likely to write about women (i.e., pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the genders of the producers, writers, and directors on thousands of films.</p>
