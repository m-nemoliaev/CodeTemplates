<p>In 1989, regional independent labels dominated with superstar signings: 
Young MC and the Pharcyde are signed to Delicious Vinyl, Biz Markie (Just a Friend), Big Daddy Kane (Smooth Operator), and Marley Marl are all on Cold Chillin'. 
Ruthless, Eazy E's label, has N.W.A. and The D.O.C. on its roster. 
Jive is crushing it with a roster that includes Boogie Down Productions, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Too $hort. 
And Tommy Boy presciently released both De La Soul and Queen Latifah's first albums.</p>
